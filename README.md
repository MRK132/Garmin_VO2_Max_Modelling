# Modelling VO2 Max from Health and Sports Stats, gathered from Garmin Smartwatch via Garmin Connect API
[VO2 Max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VO2_max) can be an indicator of overall aerobic fitness level. Using the [Garmin Connect Python API](https://pypi.org/project/garminconnect/0.1.16/), gather relevant metrics, fit to regression model and inspect feature importance metrics using SHAP ([SHapley Additive exPlanations](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/shapley.html)) values. Here I track my Running VO2 Max over the past year, and investigate if there are any particular features that impact the VO2 Max score.
